# PortfolioProjects
This is a series of projects that I worked on/am working on in Python, SQL which deal mainly with data manipulation, 
preliminary data analysis, web scrapping and other such topics. The main purpose of these projects was to enhance my 
command over these programming languages and techniques, and gain an insight into the basics of data handling.
